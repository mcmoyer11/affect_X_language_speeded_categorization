Dear Drs. Bourmayan, Stojanovic and Strickland,

I am writing to apply for the advertised post-doc position.

I graduated in 2020 with a PhD in Linguistics from Rutgers University in New Jersey. For the past two years, I worked as a postdoc with Ira Noveck at the LLF. The year prior I worked with Judith Degen as an NSF Postdoc Fellow at Stanford University. 

I'm sure you have received many great applications. I'd be a great fit, not only because of my expertise, but also because I'm motivated to remain a part of the Paris research community.

Briefly, my interests lie at the interface of language and cognition generally. How does the dynamic, situated nature of language encroach on the construction of meaning? How does natural language meaning encode information from across different cognitive domains? I've pursued these questions in various ways throughout my career, detailed further in my attached CV. 

Since the completion of my dissertation, 


Off the bat, I thought of a couple research questions I couple develop as part of your project: (1) During language processing, how does linguistically-encoded affective information (a) direct attention, (b) affect memory, (c) affect the hearer's trust in the speaker's message and (d) the hearer's trust in the speaker? (2) How does non-linguistically encoded affective information influence trust in the speaker? Are highly affective speakers seen as more or less reliable?

I have arranged for two letters of recommendation to be sent directly to you by Ira Noveck (ira.noveck@gmail.com) and Judith Degen (jdegen@stanford.edu).

As part of the LLF local XPragX organizing committee, I look forward to seeing you at the conference! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like any more information, I'd be happy to meet for coffee around town!

Thank you in advance for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing your response.

Best,
Morgan Moyer
