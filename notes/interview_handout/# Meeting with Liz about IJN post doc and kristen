notes email to paul:
i hop eyoure well

(contextualize a little)
i've been though a bunch of transitions (as we all have) 
i'm continuing to to on pragmatics work (you're familiar with)
(what is it about pragmatics that i'm interested it, demostrate that i'm me have it be substantive and methodological, in a way that makes it salient that the jean nicod thing is natural)

1. something about the substantive question that is driving me generally
2. something about the methodology

(demonstrate ira and i on the same page methodologically)

a bit of a stuggle with ira for XX reason
getting on the same philosophical level.

there's a post-doc at jean nicod that i'm excited about, but i'm struggling a little bit to think about how to make a strong application, partly because they have minimal materials in the app and partly because they're only asking for two letters and im not askin from kristn.

Do you have any advice about how i should present myself for this positoon or this post doc in general?

ira said he'd write a letter 
im trying to think positiovely

i'm not planning on asking kristen for a letter.

so i'm

Hey Paul,

I hope you're doing well.

Since Rutgers, I've been through a bunch of transitions (haven't we all). I've been finalizing a paper version of the work I did with Judith Degen during my first post doc (a whopping 50 pages). That project was a straightforward extension of my dissertation research, using corpus experimental methods to look at how the distribution over question interpretations (Mention Some and Mention All) changes with surface linguistic factors in the question (modality, wh word) as well as with the presence/absence of the immediately preceding discourse context.

I've continued to work on pragmatics here with Ira Noveck, though now on the processing of discourse connectives like 'but'/'so' vs 'and', and the different kinds of meaning they purportedly encode--discourse or 'procedural meaning' (on the Relevance Theoretic account), versus logical meaning. Maybe you remember, Cal and I worked on an acquisition project about this, where we hypothesized that children use the discourse/procedural meaning to bootstrap novel word meanings ("It's a zebra but it's blicky!" What does 'blicky' pick out? something like that). There's the long established thinking that 'and' is simpler in meaning than 'but'/'so', that the latter words mean 'and+', where '+' is the discourse-level contribution (lots of hand waving). Thus, like in the experimental lit on scalar implicature, that 'and' is processed faster than 'but'/'so' is expected, and Ira agrees. 

I was meant to look at how contextual information can facilitate the processing of 'but'/'so' in virtue of modulating the salience/relevance of the "procedural meaning" (i.e., the 'non-and' meaning). This was my contribution as an "adversarial collaborator" (his words).

I've been struggling a little with Ira during the past two years to get on the same page philosophically, perhaps in part due to the difficulty of labeling our collaboration as "adversarial" from the start.

In the end, I'm writing a paper from a more theoretical/philosophical perspective, about what procedural meaning is meant to be understood as, and how it fits within general pictures of human cognition. Unsurprisingly that has brought me back around to "psychosemantics" and the research you did on quantifiers. I see this as a positive outcome, though the road there was quite rocky.

So much for contextualizing this email!

The reason I'm writing is this: I've recently found out a post doc at the Institut Jean Nicod that I'm really excited about (details below)! I'm struggling a little to think about how to make a strong application, partly because they have minimal materials in the app and partly because they're only asking for two letters and I'm not asking one from Kristen.

I thought of some research questions related to the position that naturally arose. (1) and (2) are more low-level processing questions, while (3) is more high-level.

(1) How does affective information affect *attention* in language processing? Does highly valenced words direct the listener's attention more towards the affective agent (the person holding the affect) or more towards the content/object of the affect? This question could be addressed using a visual world paradigm that measures (the change over time in) proportion of looks from agent to object in sentences like "Lou is pissed at the cat" (high valence)/"Lou is upset at the cat" (low valence)/"Lou is looking at the cat" (control) in a context where the cat has knocked over a vase or something. 

(2) How does affective information affect *memory* of utterance content? Does highly valenced language strengthen the memory of an event? For example, does a sentence with a high valenced verb like "Lou is pissed that p" create stronger recall for the event described by p than one with a low valence like "Lou is upset that p" or a control sentence like "Lou heard that p".

(3) How does affective information (a) affect the hearer's creedence in the truth of the information and (b) the hearer's trust in the speaker? How does contextual information, beyond word valence, interact as well? A multi-parter. It's natural to test with factive verbs, comparing all emotive factives (which can vary in strength and valence), "normal" factives, and semi-factives. Participants rate from 0-1 in response to questions: (1) How certain are you that p (How likely do you think that p is true?)? vs. (2) How certain is the speaker that p (How likely do you think that the speaker believes that p?)? (questions modeled after the presupposition literature). In fact, I'd be surprised if this hasn't been done before. 

There are more clever ways to look at speaker trust. Participants can evaluate utterances from more/less affective speakers. Are highly affective speakers more trustworthy? How does the strength and valence of the affect impact trust and reliability in the speaker?

In any case, sorry for the long email.

Do you have any advice about how I should present myself for this position, or thoughts in general about the group there? Any advice would be much appreciated!

Best,
Morgan

# cover "letter" notes
use cover letter to make it personal
im super motivated to continue being part of the communicty
im in paris

id be a good fit but 

i could develop XXX which is recognizably me in terms of YYY that is recognizably you

(show already poised to do the work, write two one paragraph descriptions of studies i would undertake if i were there, and but one clause versions of the descriptions in the email


a bit cover letter-y, but say something 
have in mind a couple studies for the post doc that i would be equipped and excited to that discer

im my own person and we're helping each other out
)

im sure you have a ton of great applicants
looking forward to seeing you, if you want to talk at xprag or meet for a coffee!

# cover "letter"
Dear Drs. Bourmayan, Stojanovic and Strickland,

I writing to apply for the advertised post-doc position.

I graduated in 2020 with a PhD in Linguistics from Rutgers University in New Jersey. For the past two years, I worked as a postdoc with Ira Noveck at the LLF. Before that from 2020-2021 I worked with Judith Degen as an NSF Postdoc Fellow at Stanford. 

I'm sure you have a ton of great applicants. I'd be a great fit, not only because of my expertise, but also because I'm motivated to remain a part of the Paris research community!

My interests lie at the interface of language and cognition generally. How does the dynamic, situated nature of language encroach on the construction of meaning? How does natural language meaning encode information from across different cognitive domains? I've pursued these questions in various ways throughout my career, detailed further in my attached CV. 

I thought of a couple research questions any of which I am equipped to develop as part of your project: (1) During language processing, how does linguistically-encoded affective information (a) direct attention, (b) affect memory, (c) affect the hearer's trust in the speaker's message and (d) the hearer's trust in the speaker? (2) How does non-linguistically encoded affective information influence trust in the speaker? Are highly affective speakers seen as more or less reliable?

[ BRACKETED TEXT ]
(1) How does linguistically encoded affective information direct *attention* in language processing? Do highly valenced words direct the listener's attention more towards the affective agent (the person holding the affect) or more towards the content/object of the affect? We could answer this question using a visual world paradigm that measures the (change over time in) proportion of looks from agent to object in sentences like "Lou is pissed at the cat" (high valence)/"Lou is upset at the cat" (low valence)/"Lou is looking at the cat" (control), in a context where the cat has knocked over a vase or something. 

(2) How does linguistically encoded affective information affect *memory* of utterance content? Does highly valenced language strengthen the memory of an event? For example, does a sentence with a high valenced verb like "Lou is pissed that p" create stronger memory for the event described by p, than one with a low valence like "Lou is upset that p" or a control sentence like "Lou heard that p".

(3) How does (linguistically encoded) affective information affect (a) the hearer's belief in the truth of the information and (b) the hearer's trust in the speaker? (How does contextual information, beyond word valence, interact as well?) A multi-parter. It's natural to test with factive verbs, comparing all emotive factives (which can vary in strength and valence), "normal" factives, and semi-factives. Participants rate from 0-1 in response to questions: (1) How certain are you that p (How likely do you think that p is true?)? vs. (2) How certain is the speaker that p (How likely do you think that the speaker believes that p?)? (questions modeled after the presupposition literature). I expect there's already research out there that can speak to this question. 

(3') How does non-linguistically encoded affective information affect speaker credibility? Participants can evaluate utterances from more/less affective speakers. Are highly affective speakers more or less trustworthy? How does the strength and valence of the affect impact trust and reliability in the speaker?

As part of the LLF local XPragX organizing committee, I look forward to meeting you soon! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like any more information, I'd be happy to meet for coffee around town. 





________________________________________________________________
Study 1: How does valence affect attention in language processing?

H1: it directs the listener to attend to the agent more? (more looks to agent)
H2: it directs listener attention to the object of the affect (more looks to object)
H3: it directs attention in both directions, but over a different time course
eye tracking (changes in looks from object to agent over time)

Method: visual world paradigm + eye tracking (OR self-paced reading + eye gaze)

Cat knocks over the vase. 
Lou is angry at the cat. (high valence)
Lou is upset at the cat. (Low valence)
Lou is looking at the cat. (no valence control)

(need to control for verb morphological differences)

In VWP: measure looks to Lou versus Cat
In SPC: looks back at Lou, pauses on Cat (less clear predictions for me apriori)

________________________________________________________________
Study 2: How does valence affect memory of utterance content? 

H1: highly valenced language creates a stronger memory in the hearer of utterance content
H2: Weaker memory
H3: no effect

Method: priming study, or recall study or reaction time

"Lou is ecstatic that p" (strong) vs "Lou is happy that p" (weak) vs. "Lou believes that p"/"Lou knows that p" (controls)
What is the recall of p?


"It might be the case that p" vs. "It must be the case that p" (control for entailment strength affecting recall)

What exactly is being primed?
________________________________________________________________
Study 3: How does valence affect listener's creedence/trust in the (truth of the) speaker's utterance, in the trust of the speaker?

H1: highly valenced words increase speaker certainty (=speaker is seen as having more justification for belief)
H2: highly valenced words decrese spaker certainty (=speaker is seen as less reasonable)
H3: variability based on the type of word, and the affective content (real world plausibility)
H3': variability also based on contextual information (QUD, history of speaker's reliability)

Method: judgement task using a sliding scale from 0-1 to measure creedence as a function of affective value of statement.

Two questions: (1) How certain are you that p (How likely do you think that p is true?)? vs. (2) How certain is the speaker that p (How likely do you think that the speaker believes that p?)? (questions modeled after the presupposition literature)

Is the speaker certain? vs. is the hearer certain?
