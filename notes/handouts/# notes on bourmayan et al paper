blind sight?

efficiency?
do systems evolve towards efficiency?



it seems that the physical vs psychological divison was or apriori intreeste rather than a dimension that resulted from studying the verbs themselves....

so looking at verbs, it would benefit to be more data-driven about it rather than imposing the physical/psychological dimension brut force

experiment 1:
what exactly did the training look like? 


the notion of affect here is much different from the notion that is used in the psycholoigcal literature....here already the notion is less immediate, and even in the experimental results theselves it is downstream of *judgement*, therefore missin ghge point of what the psychological literature 



the question is whether, when it comes to MEANING, there are different components of meanin ghtat

is the valence aspect of meaning part of hte linguistic representation?
is the affetive component part of the linguistic representation?

is it conventionalized/
---> i don't think we can say that it is conventionalized ecause his iin some sense antithetical to the notion of conventionalization
but  take the example of slurs...
the feeling of disgust, is that a part of the conventional meaning? what do people say?




Affective primacy hypothesis is about states of psysiological arousal in early stages of perception....lexical meaning is a much more downstream process


million dollar question: at what point does conceptual level information enter in the workflow of perceptual processing?


Does the arousal of a verb aide in processing?
does the arousal of a verb affect judgements about the verb's meaning?

affective vs descriptive meaning: which information is more salient for completing the (pragmatic) task at hand?



Big Questions:
Is valence an aspect of word meaning???
Is valence processed quicker than descriptive meaning?


>>>what are the relevant descriptive domains of the verbs meanings (that's separate from valence)?


>>> valence as a physiological response vs. as semantic knowledge


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
polarity reversal:
hating racism vs. loving racism
neg + neg = pos / pos + neg = neg


Interestingly: playing around with sentiment analysis models on huggingface.co

Model A: (https://huggingface.co/lxyuan/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased-sentiments-student?text=i+hate+racism)

"I hate racism"
[negative: 0.971, neutral: 0.018, positive: 0.011]

"I love racism"
[negative: 0.185, neutral: 0.057, positive; .758]


Model B: (https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)
"I hate racism"
[negative: 0.876, neutral: 0.108, positive: 0.016]

"I love racism"
[negative: 0.749, neutral: 0.200, positive; .051]


how exactly would we want the model to respond?
how would humans respond?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


dossociating phys response from semantic judgement
('experiencing as' vs 'judging as such')
hating racism vs hating when my shoelaces are untied
+arousal vs -arousal



****warriner et al found reall that arousal more predictive than valence per se


CONCRETE MEASURES:
control for similarity between pairs using semantic distance (Mikolov et al 2013, pereira et al 2016 from souter et al 2022)


rather than domain, look at semantic similarity as a function of valence / arousal

Although>>>>what is the relation btw valence and similarity? are they correllated? (if so, could be a confound)




1. choose verbs based on valence/arousal ratings from warriner et al 2013


concreteness ratings for verbs
or imageability


RT ~ concreteness * valence (RE & S for items and subjects)


From Kousta (p. 8) : are abstract concepts lexically encoded stronger than concrete ones? this would make sense since abstract concepts don't necessarily have sensory information in the same way that concrete concepts would---therefore their primary "residence" would be in the mental knowledge/memory bank (lexicon?)





Bourmayan paper:
"valence question" is a proxy for evaluting emotive information




conventionalization procedures for affective/valence information must be different than for other semantic acquisition procedures since the affective componenent is inherent normative
>>>requires more complex social reasoning because it means understanding "good"/"bad"

what if there was a novel word learning task?
Concreteness (+,-) x Valence (+,-)
what do the learning times look like?
what do the response times look like?

what does speed of acquisition imply for lexicalization? 
valence information can be lexicalised faster than concreteness?

looking at error rates, if there are more error rates with valence than baselines (a feature that's not a candidate for lexicalization? but what would that be), then 

assuming that lexicalization facilitates processing?


____
Can the valence be so strong that it overrides the 


derrangement of epitaphs was acknowledgement of failures of TC meaning
even the TCs are queasy about it



From the neuro side:

EPN (~200-300ms): shows the initial response to the emotional content
larger for emotionally valenced words than neural ()

many psycholinguistic/statistical variables need to be controlled for, like word frequency, arousal, age of acquisition, familiarity, word length


Q1: Is valence lexically represented? if so, is that meaning feature processed earlier than other , "descriptive" aspects of verb meaning?

Q2: do "emotion words" give rise to a physiological (=emotion) response? Is this response faster than the 
--> need to look at neuro data, or measure heart rate to answer

Thoughts 27/2
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------


First, What is the content of the affective primacy hypothesis?


It seems that there are several different signatures of emotion in the processing of any stimnulus

- early visual processing (~100ms post-stimulus onsent)
---> correlated with processing in the limbic system

- early lexical access (~200ms pso)
---> correlated with processing in the frontal lobe

- semantic processing (~400ms pso)
---> more distributed processing throughout the brain and recurrent through the limbic system again


The exact timecourse of these processing stages can be subtly effected by various contextual or task relevant factors

Different aspects of the task can differentially direct attention in the early stages (right?)




So when we talk about the Affective Primacy Hypothesis, mayeb it's too simplistic?

affective judgements
