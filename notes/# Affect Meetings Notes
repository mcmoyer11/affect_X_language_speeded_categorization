do both studies
abstract/concrete (no neutral)
same pos/neg + neutral - three-way response


Proposal: Experiment 1: positive, negative, neutral items. DV positive, negative or neutral. Design trial blocks to look at switch costs.Are switches between valence harder than switches involving neutral? Are positive/negative faster than neutral?

Proposal: Experiment 2: positive/negative vs. abstract/concrete (between participants. same word list. no neutral items). 2 choice dv only. Is positive/negative faster than abstract/concrete? Design trials so that you have equal number of switches and non-switches. Are switch costs higher for positive/negative than abstract/concrete?2a: affect task with two response options2b descriptive task with abs/conc response options2c’: switch costs (pilot)

Morgan's tasks:
- Words size / syllable size of the word list
- frequency
- Add a training period and make more clear what the categories are meant to track

*** send summary of switch-cost and hypotheses


does the existence of a feature (perceptual or otherwise) imply core knowledge?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Thoughts/Notes 14/8 (Morgan)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Concreteness instructions from brysbaert:

Some words refer to things or actions in reality, which you can experience directly through one of the five senses. We call these words concrete words. 

Other words refer to meanings that cannot be experienced directly but which we know because the meanings can be defined by other words. 

These are abstract words. Still other words fall in-between the two extremes, because we can experience them to some extent and in addition we rely on language to understand them. We want you to indicate how concrete the meaning of each word is for you by using a 5-point rating scale going from abstract to concrete.

 A concrete word comes with a higher rating and refers to something that exists in reality; you can have immediate experience of it through your senses (smelling, tasting, touching, hearing, seeing) and the actions you do. The easiest way to explain a word is by pointing to it or by demonstrating it (e.g. To explain 'sweet' you could have someone eat sugar; To explain 'jump' you could simply jump up and down or show people a movie clip about someone jumping up and down; To explain 'couch', you could point to a couch or show a picture of a couch).

An abstract word comes with a lower rating and refers to something you cannot experience directly through your senses or actions. Its meaning depends on language. The easiest way to explain it is by using other words (e.g. There is no simple way to demonstrate 'justice'; but we can explain the meaning of the word by using other words that capture parts of its meaning).


From Warriner:
The scale ranges from 1 (happy [excited; controlled]) to 9 (unhappy [calm; in control]). At one extreme of this scale, you are happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful. When you feel completely happy you should indicate this by choosing rating 1. 

The other end of the scale is when you feel completely unhappy, annoyed, unsatisfied, melancholic, despaired, or bored. You can indicate feeling completely unhappy by selecting 9. 

The numbers also allow you to describe intermediate feelings of pleasure, by selecting any of the other feelings. 

If you feel completely neutral, neither happy nor sad [not excited nor at all calm; neither in control nor controlled], select the middle of the scale (rating 5).

Please work at a rapid pace and don’t spend too much time thinking about each word. Rather, make your ratings based on your first and immediate reaction as you read each word.

for all the words in the following .csv file, please (1) determine the valence of the word on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is negative and 7 positive, then (2) determine the concreteness/abstractness of the word on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is abstract and 7 is concrete. output the result in a csv with the words in one column, a second column with the valence judgement, and a third with the concreteness judgement.

[affect]

Given the words listed below, how do you think human participants would respond in an experimental task given the following instructions?

"In the following experiment, you will see words presented one after the other.
Your job is to categorize each word as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. You can answer by pressing the corresponding F key for negative or the J key for negative on your keyboard. Please make your evaluation as quickly as possible. For example, the word KITTEN generally has POSITIVE associations. That means thinking of kittens make you feel happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful. You can indicate a word is positive in this sense by pressing the key corresponding to POSITIVE. In contrast, the word DEATH generally has NEGATIVE associations. That means thinking of death make you feel completely unhappy, annoyed, unsatisfied, melancholic, despaired, or bored. You can indicate a word is negative in this sense by pressing the key corresponding to NEGATIVE. Please work at a rapid pace and don’t spend too much time thinking about each word. Rather, make your response based on your first and immediate reaction as you read each word. Some words may not be straightforwardly one or the other. If you feel completely neutral, neither happy nor sad, try your best to choose one option all the same."

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Morgan Notes in between meetings
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Notes 
instructions concrete: 

For example, the word KITTEN generally has CONCRETE associations. Concrete words refer to things or actions in reality, which you can experience directly through one of the five senses. You should indicate a word is concrete in this sense by pressing the key corresponding to CONCRETE.

In contrast, the word LIBERTY generally has ABSTRACT associations. Abstract words refer to things that cannot be experienced directly through your senses or actions, but which we know because their meanings can be defined by other words. You should indicate a word is abstract in this sense by pressing the key corresponding to ABSTRACT.

instructions valence:
For example, the word KITTEN generally has POSITIVE associations. That means thinking of kittens make you feel happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful. You can indicate a word is positive in this sense by pressing the key corresponding to POSITIVE.

In contrast, the word DEATH generally has NEGATIVE associations. That means thinking of death make you feel completely unhappy, annoyed, unsatisfied, melancholic, despaired, or bored. You can indicate a word is negative in this sense by pressing the key corresponding to NEGATIVE.


problems in the code:

the keys reverse from training to test
definitely for valance



ChatGPT nouns round 2:
what 10 nouns do you think people would perceive as the most positive (i.e., make them feel happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful) and refer to concrete concepts (i.e., things or actions in reality, which you can experience directly through one of the five senses)?



[pos-abs]
what 10 nouns do you think people would perceive as the most positive (i.e., make them feel happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful) and refer to abstract concepts (i.e., things that cannot be experienced directly through your senses or actions, but which we know because their meanings can be defined by other words)?

[pos-conc]
what 10 nouns do you think people would perceive as the most positive (i.e., make them feel happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful) and refer to concrete concepts (i.e., things or actions in reality, which you can experience directly through one of the five senses)?

[neg-conc]
what 10 nouns do you think people would perceive as the most negative (i.e., makes them feel completely unhappy, annoyed, unsatisfied, melancholic, despaired, or bored) and refer to concrete concepts (i.e., things or actions in reality, which you can experience directly through one of the five senses)?

[neg-abs]
what 10 nouns do you think people would perceive as the most positive (i.e., makes them feel completely unhappy, annoyed, unsatisfied, melancholic, despaired, or bored) and refer to abstract concepts (i.e., things that cannot be experienced directly through your senses or actions, but which we know because their meanings can be defined by other words)?

***remove innacurate trials

the RT difference, can it be expliained by accuracy

- look at how responses change over subsequent views of each word
- do you still see the RT difference even in the third block?

- test the final word list (as pilot)
- code in switch costs based in the test blocks (if there wasn't difference)

- start exploring potential switch cost

for a concrete judgement, switchess in valence should incur switch cost
for concrete judgement, no switch in valence won't incur switch cost

- look back at previous

- how do the word lists influence the judgements
- how does surprisal effect


preregister 

- send to everyone the references for context sensitivity hypothesis in affect first literature 


for switch cost:
(check out procedure in https://repub.eur.nl/pub/959/PSY001.pdf)
- Responses must be matched, correct answers only
- aggreage all results
- look at RT only on the second pair / second word
- explicit: if pos-pos vs neg-pos --- second should be larger



Compare RTS in 
accuracy in first block only

compare first and second responses
are the differences between Task larger?
then we can narrow down specific items


throw in a few with mean accuracy for concrete is larger than mean accuracy for valence
